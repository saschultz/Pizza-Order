#### A page to order fake pizza from, 04.07.2017

#### By Sara Schultz

## Description

As a practice with object-oriented JavaScript, this webpage simulates a build-your-own pizza ordering site. It allows the user three options to select from for the size of the pizza, and as many toppings from the listed selections as they would like. The program calculates the cost of the pizza based off of their selections and returns that to the user. If the user would like to have their pizza delivered, a form to enter their address is available upon a click -if they so choose.
